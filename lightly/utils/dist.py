### Summary of Changes:
1. Import the necessary libraries, specifically torch and dist from the torch.distributed module.
2. Fix syntax errors in the code, ensuring proper usage of torch functions and distributed operations.
3. Complete the implementation of the `gather` function by adding the necessary code inside the function.
4. Complete the implementation of the `eye_rank` function by adding the necessary code inside the function.
